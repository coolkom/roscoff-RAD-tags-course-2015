** FASTQ format and phred score

** Barcode and restriction-site checking

Similar to demultiplexing, even though the multiplexing is not really high
here.

A few diagnostic plots to see how to see how the data look like. For example,
the number of reads varies between populations. Discussion about issues, the

restriction site).

** Quality control
