*Restriction site associated DNA markers* (RAD markers or RAD tags) are used in
association with high-throughput sequencing methods for *genotyping in both
model and non-model organisms*.

RAD tags are produced by using *restriction enzymes* to cut an organism DNA and
to perform a *genome complexity reduction*. In a RAD-seq experiment, only those
fragments associated with restriction sites are sequenced. The distribution of
sequenced fragments along the genome can be adjusted by carefully choosing the
restriction enzymes.

* RAD tag course in Roscoff, March 2015

The local organizers of the course are Thomas Broquet and Didier Jollivet. The
course will be taught by Matthieu Bruneaux and Gildas Le Corguill√©.

All the materials are available from [[https://github.com/mdjbru-teaching-material/roscoff-RAD-tags-course-2015][GitHub]].
