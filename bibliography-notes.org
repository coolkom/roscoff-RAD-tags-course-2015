The idea of using restriction site associated DNA (RAD) markers on a large
scale was first introduced in a paper by [[http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/2/240.long][Miller et al. (2007)]] from Eric
A. Johnson's group.

There are important differences between methods based on *restriction site
polymorphism* (like [[http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/2/240.long][Miller et al. 2007]]) and methods that use restriction sites
as a way to *decrease genomic complexity* before sequencing.

Below are bibliography notes related to the use of RAD tags.

/Rapid and cost-effective polymorphism identification and genotyping using
restriction site associated DNA (RAD) markers/
** Abstract
- Eric A. Johnson's group at the University of Oregon
- Definition of RAD tags: "Restriction site associated DNA (RAD) tags are a
  genome-wide representation of every site of a particular restriction enzyme
  by short DNA tags"
- Here, looking for polymorphism that disrupt restriction sites (like RFLP,
  AFLP) but for many more loci than the previous methods.
- Not sequencing but use of a micro-array platform
- "RAD markers [...] allow high-throughput, high-resolution genotyping in both
  model and nonmodel systems"
** Interest of RAD tags
- Genetic mapping (recombination mapping, association mapping) needs
  "high-throughput, cost-effective methods to identify and genotype
  polymorphisms"
- Previous methods:
  + allele-specific oligonucleotide microarrays (thousands of SNPs scored per
    hybridization)
  + direct hybridization of labelled genomic DNA to short oligonucleotide
    arrays
  + single feature polymorphisms (SFP) can be discovered and typed in a similar
    way
- Those methods need costly preliminary steps (sequencing, oligonucleotide
  synthesis) and are not easily feasible for non-model organisms
** Principle
- Very good illustration in [[http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/2/240.long#F1][Figure 1]].
