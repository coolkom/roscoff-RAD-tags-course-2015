restriction site associated DNA (RAD) markers]]*

- Summary
  + Eric A. Johnson's group at the University of Oregon
  + Definition of RAD tags: "Restriction site associated DNA (RAD) tags are a
    *genome-wide representation of every site of a particular restriction enzyme
    by short DNA tags*"
  + Here, looking for polymorphism that disrupt restriction sites (like RFLP,
    AFLP) but for many more loci than the previous methods.
  + Not sequencing but use of a micro-array platform
  + "*RAD markers [...] allow high-throughput, high-resolution genotyping in
    both model and nonmodel systems*"
- Interest of RAD tags
  + Genetic mapping (recombination mapping, association mapping) needs
    "high-throughput, cost-effective methods to identify and genotype
    polymorphisms"
  + Previous methods:
    - allele-specific oligonucleotide microarrays (thousands of SNPs scored per
      hybridization)
    - direct hybridization of labelled genomic DNA to short oligonucleotide
      arrays
    - single feature polymorphisms (SFP) can be discovered and typed in a similar
      way
  + Those methods need costly preliminary steps (sequencing, oligonucleotide
    synthesis) and are not easily feasible for non-model organisms
- Principle
  + Very good illustration in [[http://genome.cshlp.org/content/17/2/240.long#F1][Figure 1]].
  + Digest - link tags - shear DNA - purify tags - release tags - type tags
- Demonstration
  + Mapping of a breakpoint on a /Drosophila/ chromosome
  + Identification of the major lateral plate locus in three-spine stickleback
- Discussion
  + Here RAD markers use the *restriction site as the polymorphic marker* (no
    sequencing)
  + Easy to produce microarray type of genotyping resource
  + Bulk genotyping is possible
  + If markers location is determined, genetic mapping is possible

- Discussed also in [[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id%3D10.1371/journal.pone.0034241][Puritz 2012]] ("Next-Generation Phylogeography: A Targeted
  Approach for Multilocus Sequencing of Non-Model Organisms") in which they use
  454 sequencing:
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "However, few of [the NGS] technologies have been applied in phylogeographic
  studies, with the exception of Emerson et al. (42) that used
  restriction-site-associated DNA tags (RAD tags) (43,44) to determine the
  evolutionary relationship between recently diverged populations of pitcher
  plant mosquitos. This methodology can genotype multiple populations at
  thousands of SNP loci simultaneously, but have limited ability to survey
  large sample sizes within populations because of the cost. For example,
  Emerson et al. genotyped 21 different population at ,13,627 different SNPs
  but with only 6 individuals per population the authors were forced to
  restrict their analysis to 3,741 SNPs ‘‘that were fixed within at least two
  populations and were variable among populations’’ and generate one consensus
  sequence per locus per population (42). Our targeted 454 sequencing
  methodology offers a compromise with the ability to sequence a reasonable
  sample size (20 individuals) from one population for 10 different nDNA loci
  (,400 bp each) in 1/16th of a plate of 454 sequencing, at lower cost than a
  RAD tag analysis."

- No strict homing behaviour but genetic heterogeneity and morphological and
  behavioural diversity
- RAD-seq from 518 individuals (7 libraries of 96 individually barcoded
  samples)
- 4439 SNPs, 162 potentially adaptive as detected by outlier tests (formed four

- "Genomic scans using highly dispersive species may be one way to overcome
  this challenge, because minimal population structure provides a less noisy
  neutral back- ground of genetic divergence upon which adaptive markers can be
  readily distinguished as outliers (Pe′rez- Figueroa et al. 2010)."
