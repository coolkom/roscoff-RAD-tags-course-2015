The study in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05749.x/abstract">Bruneaux et al. (2013)</a> focus on several freshwater and marine
populations of ninespine stickleback from Fenno-Scandia. Those populations are
relatively recent since this region was recolonized after the last glacial
maximum (ca. 11000 years BP). They differ in several morphological, behavioural
and physiological traits.

<p>
In general, fish from the freshwater ponds where ninespine is the only fish
species are larger, bolder and more aggressive than their marine counterparts,
and also harbour reduced body armour. This is thought to be due to differences
in intra and interspecific competition, and lab crosses have shown that the
traits are at least partially genetically determined.

The aim of the study was to look for the genetic basis of differentiation
between the different habitat types, and investigate if signals of parallel
evolution could be found. For this species, no reference genome is
available. However, the genome of the (relatively) closely related threespine
stickleback is available and annotated in Ensembl.

Twenty individuals from each population were sampled and their DNA was
extracted. The DNA was digested by two restriction enzymes and size-selected,
and equal amounts of RAD fragments per individuals were then pooled into
population-specific pools. Those pools were barcoded (one barcode per
population) and sent for sequencing in an Illumina GAII system, using
paired-end sequencing.
