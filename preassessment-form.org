* Prior experience with high-throughput sequencing

1. Have you been involved in a high-throughput sequencing project before, or
   are you currently involved in one?

2. If you have replied "Yes" to the previous question, please answer the
   following questions:
   - What was/is the project question (in one sentence)?
   - What type of high-throughput sequencing method was/is used?
   - What was/is your role in the project (experimental design, sequence data
     analysis, downstream analysis, ...)?

3. Do you know what the FASTQ format is?

4. Do you know what is a PHRED quality score?

5. Given a set of raw reads in FASTQ format, would you be able to perform
   simple quality control and sequence trimming? If yes, which tool(s) would
   you use?

6. Given a set of clean reads, would you be able to perform a de novo
   assembly into contigs? If yes, which tool(s) would you use?

7. Given a reference sequence (e.g. genome) and clean reads, would you be able
   to map back the reads to the reference? If yes, which tool(s) would you use?

8. Given an alignment of reads from different individuals, would you be able to
   identify sequence variants? If yes, which tool(s) would you use?

9. Given an alignment of reads from different individuals, would you be able to
   determine individual genotypes? If yes, which tool(s) would you use?

10. Given an alignment of reads from different individuals, would you be able to
    determine allele frequencies? If yes, which tool(s) would you use?

11. Given a coding sequence and a list of identified variants, would you be
    able to determine which variants are synonymous and which are
    non-synonymous at the amino-acid level?

   apply.)
   - I have never programmed.
   - I write scripts that are a few lines long to analyze data.
   - I write programs that are a page or two long for my own use.
   - I write programs that are many pages long for my own use and for others to
     use.
   - I am primarily a programmer.

4. How familiar do you think you are with the command line?
   - I am not familiar at all with the command line.
   - I am familiar only with the name "command line".
   - I am familiar with the command line but have never used it.
   - I am familiar with the command line because I have or am using it.
