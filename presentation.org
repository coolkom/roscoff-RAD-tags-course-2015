- Not a population geneticist, not a bioinformatician
- Evolutionary biologist who dropped into a RAD-seq project when he was
  post-doc
- Some things are probably wrong!

* Introduction: RAD-seq and population genomics

** What are RAD markers?
Miller et al. 2007
restriction site polymorphism

** RAD-seq

** Single read vs. paired ends
Examples, applications

** ddRAD
Examples, applications
(population genomics, mapping, QTL, phylogeography, ...)
or put those appplications in more general context?
nonmodel species, marker discovery
anything that needs lots of markers in lots of individuals or pools

** Other flavours

** Typical analysis
Depends on the question and objectives!
Experimental/sampling design
DNA extraction, library preps
Barcoding? pooling?
Sequencing (service?)
Reads cleaning
demultiplexing
assembly or alignment (mapping if reference available)
genotype calling
RAD stops here (i.e. lots of markers and allele frequencies for different populations or genotypes for individuals)
Downstream analysis:
- genome scan
- Fst, Gst, outlier detection
- Phylogeography
- Parallel evolution
- and many other things...

* Practicals

** General workflow scheme

** One complete project

** Tour of other tools and specific analyses
To illustrate some specific points (e.g. likelihood or bayesian based genotyping
or allele frequency estimates or Fst calculations, ...)
