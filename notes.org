* Course about RAD-tag sequencing - Roscoff 2015

** Problematic
- High coverage
- Genome reduction
- Non-model species

** Presentation of the RAD-tag approach (history)
- Protocol
- Single or double digest
- Single end or paired ends

** Use of RAD tags
- SNP discovery
- Population genetics
- Functional genomics

* Practicals

** Teaching objectives
- Sequence quality check: trimming, quality control
- Stack building (STACKS or other tools, with or without paired-ends
  information)
- SNP calling and genotyping (VCFtools)
- Allele frequency estimates (individuals or pools?)
- Population genetics: comparison of microsats and SNPs trees (cf. Anti)
- Population genomics: localisation, genome profiling and Gst calculation,
  kernel smoothing
- Functional analysis (outside the scope of RAD-tags /sensus stricto/)
